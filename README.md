Things to do:

1. Write a useful README that describes how your system works and varios parameters (5%)
2. Clean up code (watch out for tabbing issues) and add comments if necessary (prolly fucking not though)
3. Test if we get the configuration parameters correct. This could mean messing around with Config.txt and making sure
it still works.
4. Make sure it works when sites have errors (5%)
5. SIGHUP or nah?
6. Protection against varios configuration errors. Aka make sure that the ranges given to us are enforced and describe
how we handle them in the README
