For the first extra credit, we created an html file that takes in user input to choose a file and then displays a graph
of the frequencies for each of the phrases found on each of the sites. To use it, simply type in the file you would like
graphed (i.e. 1.csv) and click the button. To load another graph, please reload the page and type in another file name.
The graphs are produced from d3 visualization tools.

The file containing the html is called ec.html

Note: We had to use the most updated version of Firefox for this to work.
